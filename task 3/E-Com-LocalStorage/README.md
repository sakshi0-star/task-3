<details>
  <summary><h2>üìëThe Initial Guidelines for the projectüìö</h2></summary>

### Here are the key tasks that need to be completed in this project:

```txt
 ‚úÖ Check if the API call was made.
 ‚úÖ Check if the filter is working.
 ‚úÖ Students can loop through the data and append it in the JavaScrip DOM.
 ‚úÖ Add a product to the cart and check the alert.
 ‚úÖ Add the same product to the cart and check the alert.
 ‚úÖ Go To the cart page and check if able to show on DOM & the total price is working fine.
 ‚úÖ Check the quantity part. See if the total gets updated when the quantity changes.
 ‚úÖ Check the delete product part.
```

### Problem Statement:

- In this application, we have 2 different pages:
  1. index.html(Home Page)
  2. cart.html(Cart Page)

#### index.html(Home Page):

- First, make an API request with fetch in this API end-point:-
  `https://dbioz2ek0e.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/mockapi/get-tech-products`.
- If you successfully do that you will get some e-commerce product data(Array of Objects).
- In the template, there is a div with an id:- `product-container`.
- You have to loop over the data and create small cards based on the data and append them to the above-mentioned div.
- Show 4 cards per row with a display grid.

- Here we also have a select tag with an id:- `filter`.
- Using this select tag you should be able to filter the products with their category.
- Use array.filter() method to filter the products by their category.
- Each Product card should have a button with the text: `Add To Cart`.
- When clicked on this button product data should be added to local storage with a key `cart`.
- The user should not be able to add the same product to the cart multiple times.
- If adding to cart is successful show an alert with the text: `Product Added To Cart` else show an alert with the text: `Product Already in Cart`.

#### cart.html(Cart Page):

- On this page, all the data will come from the localstorage with the key `cart`.
- Loop over the localstorage data and show them in smaller cards inside and div with id:- `cart-container` (Given in the template).
- Now each of the cards also has a span tag where you can see the quantity of the product. By default, the quantity should be 1.
- there are also two buttons and by using them you can increment/decrement the quantity.
- Each card should also have a button with the text `Remove`. Clicking on that this particular cart should be deleted.
- Please follow this structure for the cards:

```html
<div>
  <img src="image" />
  <h2>Brand</h2>
  <h3>Price</h3>
  <p>Details</p>
  <p>Category</p>
  <button>+</button> -> increment button
  <span>quantity</span>
  <button>-</button> -> decrement button <button>Remove</button> -> Remove
  button
</div>
```

- Please make sure all the buttons have the same text as the given structure.
- In the template, we also have a span tag with id:- `cart-total`.
- Here you have to show the total value of the cart.
- Make sure whenever the quantity gets modified the total price is updated. (Total is = sum of (quantity \* price) of all products in cart).
- Please take a look at the below image for a better understanding:
